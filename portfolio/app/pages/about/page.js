              Iâ€™m currently a senior studying Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. Aside from focusing on academia, I am a software
              developer who enjoys many hobbies such as cooking, weightlifting, playing video games, traveling, fishing, photography, and more.
              Throughout my time in university I have been involved in various organizations and have created multiple personal projects as well. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Whether I'm coding a new application, creating or learning a new dish, or exploring the world through my camera lens, I love tackling new
              challenges and sharing what I have learned along the way. Thank you for stopping by - I'm looking forward to connecting, collaborating, and
              growing as not only a developer, but as a person as well.
